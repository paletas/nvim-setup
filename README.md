# nvim-setup

I'm just trying out vim for the first time, using neovim, so this will certainly evolve over time.

I'm following ThePrimeagen tutorial for now, getting used to motions and plugins, and once I'm confortable I'm sure to play around with everything to my own liking.

How to setup:
1. cd ~/.config/nvim
1. git pull https://github.com/paletas/nvim-setup
